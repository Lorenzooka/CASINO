# Infinity-777 Casino — Project Skeleton

This skeleton archive contains a minimal directory structure for the **Infinity‑777 Casino** project. It includes placeholder directories and a basic smart contract example to get started. You can expand upon this structure by adding the full code for contracts, the web app, services, Kubernetes manifests, and other resources.

## Structure

- **contracts/** — Example Solidity contracts (skeleton only).
- **web/** — Placeholder for a Next.js web application.
- **services/** — Placeholder for Node.js microservices (monitor, indexer, scheduler, KYC stub).
- **k8s/** — Placeholder for Kubernetes deployment manifests.
- **docs/** — Placeholder for documentation such as runbooks, metrics guides, etc.
- **ops/** — Placeholder for operational tooling (Docker Compose, Helm charts, load tests).

## How to use this skeleton

1. Replace the example Solidity files in `contracts/` with your full smart contracts.
2. Scaffold a Next.js application inside `web/`, or move your existing `web` directory here.
3. Populate `services/` with your monitoring and scheduling scripts.
4. Add your Kubernetes manifests under `k8s/` for deployment.
5. Document your runbooks and guides under `docs/`.
6. Use `ops/` for Docker and operational scripts.

Feel free to adapt and extend this structure as needed for your project.
